# fastify

fastify's goal is to be a dependencyless, intuitive [Worker](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/44251ce8eaa0def807b9867f73ee23adfb539487/docs/runtime/workers.md)-based parallelization library for [Deno](https://deno.land).

As this is currently a personal project in its very early stages, I'm working on a little [TODO](TODO.md) list which serves as a small roadmap. It will be updated as the project matures.
